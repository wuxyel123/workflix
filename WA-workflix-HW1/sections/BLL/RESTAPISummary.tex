\subsection{REST API Summary}

The rest API is studied to experiment with multiple different approaches to the REST paradigm. More in detail, endpoints associated with rides and devices are developed in a more traditional way, with the entirety of the information needed to satisfy the request directly in the URI.
Other endpoints require additional information (such as the type of operation required) as additional parameters in the request.\\

Part of the URIs are filtered through different filters. M indicates that only users with the role of Manager can access to the endpoint, E indicates that only editors can access the endpoint, A that only administrators can request the specified URI to the server.
