\subsection{SignIn Login}

In a web application, "sign in" or "login" refers to the process of accessing a user's account within the application by providing the appropriate credentials, such as a username or email address and password.\\

The purpose of the sign-in process is to authenticate the user and grant access to the application's features and content that are specific to the user's account.\\

Typically, the sign-in or login page is the first page a user encounters when accessing a web application and requires the user to enter their credentials before proceeding to the main dashboard or homepage.\\

The sign-in process is essential for ensuring the security and privacy of the user's account and data within the web application.\\
