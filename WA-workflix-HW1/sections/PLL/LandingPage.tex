\subsection{Landing Page}
The landing page is divided into two sections: “header” and “body”. \\
In the 'Header' area, there are two sub-sections. On the left, the logo of our 
website 'WorkFlix' is displayed. In the second homework, our team will design the log.
On the right, the main navigation is composed of two major functions of the landing page, namely, log-in and sign-up.
By clicking on the text, users will be directed to the login and sign-up page.\\
In the 'Body' area, the container is divided into two parts. 
The left part is the slogan to attract users' attention and demonstrate WorkFlix's main function.
Under the slogan, there is a button for users to sign up. 
The left part is an image banner, which uses an image to highlight the website's using scenario. \\
